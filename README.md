# University-Projects
Code I have written for various different University projects.
Note the most recent projects 
        - Fourier Transformations written in C and some python; C code for discrete and inverse fourier transformations, with some graphs produced in python
        - Magnetic Braking written in python; contains code for graphs displayed in a Lab Report on a magnetic braking experiment
